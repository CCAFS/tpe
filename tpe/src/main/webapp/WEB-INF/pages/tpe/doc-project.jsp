					<h4>Project Summary</h4>
					<p>The Target Population Environment Platform is part of the
						2years collaborative project between EMBRAPA and CIAT
						"Methodological development of an online tool for the
						identification of Target Population Environments: improving the
						predictions of agricultural production using crop models".</p>
					<p>The two-year project (2012 - 2014) aims to calibrate and
						validate models for improved yield prediction and to develop an
						online tool for the identification of Target Population
						Environments (TPEs), i.e., a set of environments to which the
						improved crop varieties developed by breeding programs need to be
						adapted. The research attempts to support the implementation of
						TPEs globally for important crops, to understand their behavior
						under different environmental conditions and to contribute to
						decision making in breeding programs. The project will deliver the
						second objective of Theme 1 on Adaptation to Progressive Change,
						"Develop breeding strategies for addressing abiotic and biotic
						stresses under future climate change, including changes in the
						mean and variability of climate,".</p>
					<p>The overall goal of TPE Platform is to show the results of
						the identification and characterization of TPE zones for rice and
						bean production areas in Colombia and Brazil and provides a module
						for replicating the same kind of analysis in other geographical
						areas.</p>
