						on Target Population of Environments (TPE) identification for Rice
						and Beans in Colombia and Brazil</h1></a>
				<p>The development of the agricultural sector in recent years
					has been marked by great challenges due to new conditions and
					permanent changes in the global climate regime, challenges which
					present an imminent risk to food security for the most vulnerable.
					It is crucial to cooperate and work together across multiple
					countries and institutions to seek strategies and appropriate
					response mechanisms against such eventualities.</p>

						the aim for crop breeders using target population environments</h1></a>
				<p>There's no such thing as a compass for climate change, for
					starters, and it's hard to say whether crop varieties currently in
					development will still be adequate for conditions on the ground 10
					years from now. So what do breeders have to aim at, exactly? For
					most crop breeding programs, the customary answer to that question
					has always been the same: cultivars with a) improved potential
					production, b) resistance to pests, or c) resistance to diseases.</p>
