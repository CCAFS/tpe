					<h1>Upland rice in central Brazil</h1>
					<p>The upland rice (UR) breeding program strategy is to perform
						direct grain yield selection in optimal growing conditions.
						Drought stress conditions, however, are prevalent across central
						Brazil, and hence limit the efficiency of the UR breeding program.
						We analyzed these drought conditions across the UR growing region.</p>

					</div>

					<p>Using the crop model Oryza2000 for the variety BRS
						Primavera, we find three Environment Groups (see map):</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Highly favorable environment (HFE), representing 19 % of
							the seasons and with mean yield of 3,168 kg/ha</li>
						<li>Favorable environment (FE), representing 44 % and with
							mean yield of 2,610 kg/ha</li>
						<li>Least favorable environment (LFE), with the lowest yield
							(1,661 kg ha-1) and representing 37 % of the seasons.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Environmental groups for upland rice in central Brazil. The
						map shows the the most frequent EG. Blue corresponds to the highly
						favorable environment (HFE); yellow corresponds to the favorable
						environment (FE); and beige corresponds to the least favorable
						environment (LFE).</p>

					<p>For each EG, we analyzed the ratio of actual to potential
						evapotranspiration to determine stress profiles. Our analyses
						indicate:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>For the HFE, the two stress patterns we found correspond
							to stress-free conditions (69 % occurrence, profile 1, see image
							below) and to terminal drought stress (31 % occurrence, profile
							2).</li>
						<li>For the FE, the stress profiles are: profile [1]
							reproductive stress (41 % occurrence); profile [2] terminal
							drought stress (40 % occurrence); and profile [3] severe
							reproductive stress (19 % occurrence).</li>
						<li>For the LFE, the three stress patterns are: [1]
							reproductive (68 %); [2] terminal (14 %); and [3]
							reproductive-to-grain-filling (17 %).</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="img">
					<img src="${ctx}/resources/rice_profiles.png" alt="image" /></div>
					<p>Drought stress patterns for each upland rice EG. HFE: highly
						favorable environment; FE: favorable environment; and LFE: least
						favorable environment. Stress types for each environment with
						numbers representing the frequency of occurrence of stress
						patterns in EGs. The first and second vertical dashed lines show
						the average panicle initiation and flowering dates for each EG,
						respectively</p>

					<p>Our results indicate that the strategy of the breeding
						program should be adjusted as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>In the best environment (HFE, 19 % occurrence), the
							current strategy of selection under optimal conditions in the
							Santo Antonio de Goi&#225s nursery is likely to perform well.</li>
						<li>In the favorable environment (FE, 44 % occurrence), one
							option is to perform selection for wide adaptation to drought,
							and a second option is to weight the performance of genotypes
							according to the representativeness of the growing environments
							where they are tested (i.e. weighted selection).</li>
						<li>For the least favorable environment (LFE, 37 %
							occurrence), we suggest selection for high yield in environments
							under reproductive stress.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Based on our analyses, we estimate that a four-fold increase
						in the coverage of the UR breeding program is possible if breeding
						targeted specific selection in drought environments. Realising
						this potential, however, will ultimately depend on the existence
						and efficiency of seed systems, and on the adoption barriers to
						new germplasm.</p>

					<h1 id="common-beans-casestudy">Common beans in Goi&#225s, Brazil</h1>
					<p>In the state of Goi&#225s, common bean production occurs in
						three growing seasons or `zafras`. A first season (wet season) for
						which sowing occurs between 1st Nov. and 31st Dec.; a second
						season (dry season) for which sowing occurs between 1st Jan. and
						28th Feb.; and a third season (winter season) for which sowing
						occurs from 1st May to 30th Jun. We analyzed drought stress
						patterns in the wet and dry seasons in order to determine the
						extent to which the current strategy of the common bean breeding
						program (i.e. selection under optimal conditions) needs to be
						adjusted.</p>
						<div class="img">

					</div> 
					<p>Using the DSSAT model for the varieties P&#225rola and BRS
						Radiante, we found the following environments for the two growing
						seasons (see maps below):</p>
					<ul>
						<li>For the wet season (top maps), two different EGs exist: a
							highly favorable environment (HFEw, 44 % occurrence, mean yield
							of 3,655 kg/ha) and a favorable environment (FEw, 56 %
							occurrence, mean yield of 2,870 kg/ha).</li>
						<li>For the dry season (bottom maps), we also find two EGs:
							highly favorable environment (HFEd, 58 % occurrence) and
							favorable environment (FEd, 42 % occurrence). Yields in HFEd were
							roughly twice as large as in FEd (i.e. 2,781 vs. 1,356 kg ha-1).</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Maps of environmental groups for the dry bean wet (top maps)
						and dry (bottom maps) seasons in Goi&#225s, Brazil. The left maps show
						the the most frequent EG for early planting (i.e. during Nov. for
						the wet season and during Jan. for the dry season), and the right
						maps show the most frequent EG for late planting (i.e. during Dec.
						for the wet season and Feb. for the dry season).</p>

					<p>Using the five-day mean values of the water stress index
						(i.e. ratio of actual to potential transpiration), we find the
						following stress profiles:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>For the highly favorable environment in the wet season
							(HFEw): stress-free (pattern 1 in top panel of figure below)
							occurs in 86-88 % of seasons depending on cultivar; and
							terminal-reproductive stress (pattern 2) occurs 12-14 %.</li>
						<li>For the favorable environment in the wet season FEw,
							stress-free conditions (pattern 1) are also the most frequent
							with 80 % occurrence for both cultivars, whereas
							terminal-reproductive drought stress (pattern 2) occurs only 20 %
							of the times.</li>
						<li>For the dry season, HFEd consists of two stress profiles:
							[1] stress-free conditions, which occurs 79-80 % of the time
							depending on the cultivar; and [2] terminal-reproductive drought
							stress, which occurs 20-21 % of the time depending on the
							cultivar.</li>
						<li>For FEd, terminal drought stress (pattern 1) represents
							56-62 % of conditions, whereas terminal-reproductive drought
							stress represents 44-58 % of conditions.</li>

					<p>Drought stress patterns for favorable environment (FE) and
						highly favorable environment (HFE) for wet (top) and dry (bottom)
						common beans growing seasons and for both P&#233rola and BRS Radiante
						cultivars.</p>
					<p>In the rainfed seasons, drought-stress conditions occur
						about 25 % of the time for both cultivars P&#225rola and BRS Radiante.
						For the common bean breeding program, a 25 % frequency of
						occurrence of moderate drought means that germplasm selection
						under drought conditions may not be warranted. However, because
						yield reductions from drought can be above 50 % compared to
						stress-free conditions, it may be desirable to include drought
						response as part of their selection criteria. Further research
						will be needed to identify other stresses that cause yield
						reductions in the wet and dry seasons in relation to the winter
						season.</p>
